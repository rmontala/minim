Enough procrastination. It's time.

I can't explain what made me finally start after these months, but here I am. I guess I will write about it once I find it.

Welcome to minim.blog, a place that talks about existential and digital minimalism and that is crafted and hosted minimally.

I commit to writing every Sunday - I will share a manifesto soon.

Because it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

Thank you for reading.
